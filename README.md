# Suggestions

The place where you can share ideas for Dalamud plugins. If you want to make a plugin, just look for issues tagged with `unclaimed`!

Remember that suggested plugins must follow [Dalamud's Plugin Guildelines](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher#isnt-this-cheating).

## How does this repository work?

### Submitting an idea
It can pretty much be anything you want. We'll then do a quick review of the plugin and mark it as up for grabs; as long as it's not a duplicated request, the idea already exists, or goes against the [Dalamud's Plugin Guildelines](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher#isnt-this-cheating)..

**Make sure when submitting your idea to follow the provided template**. Invalid requests will be rejected automatically, and repeated offenders may see their ability to create suggestions restricted.

### Working on a plugin
If you want to work on a plugin, make sure to let us know by replying to the issue so we can assign you and mark it as ``in progress``. We don't want to waste peoples time by having different people working on the same feature, and we want to keep the Dalamud plugin ecosystem as clean as possible, which includes avoiding duplicates.

After accepting a request, if you no longer have time to work on it, there's nothing wrong about it. Just let us know on the GitHub thread, so we can release the suggestion for someone else to work on it.

### I really want *x* plugin but I can't code
If you find a plugin that you would like to see, be sure to add a :+1: (+1) to it! This way plugin developers will be able to see what plugins are desired the most. Please do not bother the devs to make a plugin, they don't have all day everyday to make plugins for us so be patient!

Please avoid "bumping" issues by posting "+1", or asking if someone's willing to work on it. It can be frustrating to wait for an issue to complete, but it is even more frustrating to send junk emails to everyone (and make Staff' triage work harder!).

### Workflow
You can find the different labels for the suggestions [here](https://github.com/goatcorp/suggestions/labels).
* All suggestions start as ``discussion required``.
* The dev team will review and move the suggestion to the next stage.
* If everything looks okay, it will be labeled as `unclaimed` and is ready to be picked up by an interested developer.
* If the suggestion has already existed, it will be closed and marked as `duplicate`.
* If it doesn't align with the guidelines, it will be closed with an explanation and marked as `unsupported`.
* If we can't understand your suggestion and need more details, we will mark it as `unclear`. You'll have 30 days to reply before the suggestion is automatically closed.
* Other labels are used as appropriate such as `good first issue` or `research needed`.
* Suggestions that are inactive for 90 days will be labeled as `stale` (but remain open).
